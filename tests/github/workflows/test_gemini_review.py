# These tests would typically involve using tools like `act` to simulate GitHub Actions runs
# or interacting with the GitHub API to trigger and monitor workflow runs.

# Example structure (implementation details would depend on test setup):

# @pytest.mark.workflow
# def test_gemini_review_workflow_runs_on_pr_open():
#     """
#     Tests that the gemini-review workflow is triggered on pull_request opened event.
#     - Use `act` or GitHub API to simulate a pull_request opened event.
#     - Verify that the workflow run is initiated.
#     - Monitor the workflow run status.
#     """
#     pass

# @pytest.mark.workflow
# def test_gemini_review_workflow_completes_successfully():
#     """
#     Tests that the gemini-review workflow completes successfully.
#     - Trigger a workflow run.
#     - Monitor the workflow run status until completion.
#     - Verify that the final status is success.
#     """
#     pass

# Add more workflow tests for different scenarios and configurations.
