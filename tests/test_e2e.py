# End-to-end tests would typically require a live GitHub repository and API access.
# These tests would simulate the full workflow triggered by a GitHub event,
# such as a pull request being opened or synchronized.

# Example structure (implementation details would depend on test setup):

# @pytest.mark.e2e
# def test_pr_review_workflow():
#     """
#     Tests the complete pull request review workflow.
#     - Trigger a pull request event (e.g., using a test repository and GitHub API).
#     - Verify that the GitHub Action runs.
#     - Verify that the ActionHandler is invoked with the correct context.
#     - Verify that the AI model generates a response.
#     - Verify that a review comment is posted on the pull request.
#     """
#     pass

# @pytest.mark.e2e
# def test_issue_comment_workflow():
#     """
#     Tests the complete issue comment workflow.
#     - Trigger an issue comment event.
#     - Verify the workflow execution.
#     - Verify that a comment is posted on the issue.
#     """
#     pass

# Add more end-to-end tests for different scenarios and commands.
